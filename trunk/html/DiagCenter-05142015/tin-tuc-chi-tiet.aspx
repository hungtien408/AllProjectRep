                        <p>We know that one in five multiple myeloma patients die in the first two months, one out of four in the first year. What could possibly be the reason?  Usually a myeloma patient will have symptoms, which will send them to their family doctor. But why do many myeloma patients wait until they have advanced disease to see hematologists/oncologists?</p>
                        <p>Could it be that some patients refuse to see a doctor until they have let their disease progress too far?  I hope not. This is the Macho or Martyr approach to healthcare. So why do we continue to have the misdiagnosis, slow diagnosis, and lack of diagnosis?  The sad fact is that even family practitioners lack knowledge about multiple myeloma.</p>
